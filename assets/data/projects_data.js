            Alongside 5 other colleagues on my _nology bootcamp and with the guidance of some of 
            the coaches, I implemented a platform that allows coaches to keep track of different
            students and the progress they have made with projects assigned to them during the bootcamp.

            The frontend and backend API are 2 separate applications designed to communicate 
            with each other to perform various data manipulation tasks (backend API is connected to 
            a MYSQL database).

            There is a strong likelihood that _nology will continue to develop this platform to eventually
            use it for real.
