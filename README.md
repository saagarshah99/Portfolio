## Description:
This is my development portfolio which outlines a little bit about what I am doing, some of my technical skills and some of the projects I have worked on. It is currently written in HTML, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript. It also utilises the Devicons and Font Awesome libraries for various icons. It has been optimised to display well on different browser/screen sizes.
